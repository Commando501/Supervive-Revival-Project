# SUPERVIVE Revival — project rules for Claude

This is a reverse-engineering project to revive a Steam-launched UE5.4 game whose
official backends are dead. We've redirected the client to a local Go server
(`server/cmd/ags`) over hosts-file + HTTPS-with-self-signed-cert. The work spans
backend RE, IoStore extraction, native shim injection, and asset-registry patching.
Lots of dead ends. Honor the prior-work docs.

## Before doing anything else

### If the user mentions hero/roster/grid/hunters/store/cosmetics/missions modal
**READ `docs/hero-roster-attempts.md` FIRST.** It's the living log of every attempt.
Eight backend/native/AR-patch hypotheses have been tested and falsified. The empty
ALL HUNTERS grid, the "?" preview, the empty STORE carousel, the empty COSMETICS
browser, and the empty MISSIONS modal **all share one root cause** (LokiAssetManager
bypasses the enumeration scan). Backend route is conclusively closed; only two
client-side routes remain open (IoStore mod-pak overlay, deeper native shim RE).
Do not re-grind the backend hypotheses. Cross-reference
`memory/supervive-hero-roster-blocker.md`.

### Before touching anything menu-shaped
Skim `docs/trackb-notes.md` (Track B endpoint surface + ClientProfileData model)
and `docs/endpoints.md` (every endpoint the client hits + handler status).

### Before touching anything extraction-shaped
Skim `docs/findings.md` and `docs/r2-findings.md` (IoStore catalog + usmap RE +
the non-standard UObjectBase layout in this build: nameOff=0x20, classOff=0x18,
NOT the stock 0x18/0x10). `docs/game-map.md` has the full 68,228-asset catalog.

### Before touching anything AR-bin-shaped
Read `docs/trackb-assetregistry-route.md`. The `assetregistry apply-patch`
extractor subcommand works end-to-end; loose-file AR.bin deployment has been
proven INERT in this IoStore build (UE ignores the loose file even when valid).
Deployment requires an IoStore mod-pak overlay — non-trivial.

## Launch / run procedure

From an **ELEVATED PowerShell**:
```powershell
cd "G:\git\Supervive Revival Project"
.\configs\launch-redirect.ps1
```

**Steam must be running first**, or login dies with `Auth Failure 14005` (SteamAPI
init fails). Easy to miss; surface this gotcha if you see Steam not running.

The script blocks until the game exits. Read live `Loki.log` at
`C:\Users\eastr\AppData\Local\SUPERVIVE\Saved\Logs\Loki.log` (NOT `docs/` — that's
the backend `capture.log` for HTTP traffic).

For iterative server-only restarts (game already running at menu, want to swap
backend behavior): kill `ags`, rebuild with
`& "$env:ProgramFiles\Go\bin\go.exe" build -C server -o server\ags.exe ./cmd/ags`,
restart manually (regen certs + re-append to cacert.pem if you want a clean cert
chain). See `docs/hero-roster-attempts.md` "How to reproduce" for the exact recipe.

## Code conventions for this project

- Backend handlers live in `server/internal/<package>/<name>.go`. Each handler's
  comment block should record what was tried + what worked + what didn't, with
  dates. The trial-and-error history is the value.
- Probe-driven backend work: prefer **single-variable changes**. Bundled tests
  (10 changes at once) have repeatedly produced ambiguous results that wasted
  cycles. If a hypothesis fails, REVERT the probe before testing the next one.
- Validity model for endpoints: UE's `JsonObjectStringToUStruct` IGNORES unknown
  JSON keys and only rejects the whole doc when a key that DOES match has a wrong
  type. So adding speculative fields is safe; sending wrong-typed matched fields
  is not. See the comment at the top of `server/internal/menu/menu.go` for the
  full validity model.
- The two distinct LogLokiPlatformQuery error strings mean different things:
  `"Invalid response received"` = a required top-level field is absent.
  `"Deserialization failure"` = JSON parsed but container type mismatched target struct.

## Tooling shortcuts

- **Extractor:** `tools/extractor/` — .NET 9 / CUE4Parse-based. Subcommands:
  `enumerate`, `names`, `namesall`, `dump`, `raw`, `schema`, `assetregistry`.
  Build/run with
  `& "$env:ProgramFiles\dotnet\dotnet.exe" run -c Release` from `tools/extractor/extractor`.
- **usmap regeneration:** `tools/usmapdump/usmapdump.exe extract <exe-path>`
  produces `mappings.usmap`. Needed when game updates.
- **usmapdump RE commands:** `strings`, `wstrings`, `xref`, `disasm`, `peek`,
  `threads`, `findgametid`, `assetmgr` — read-only RPM, no injection.
- **Manual mapper / DLL injector:** `tools/inject/` — for no-throw payloads only
  (C++ exception unwinding gets eaten by the packer's vectored exception filter).

## What NOT to do

- Don't run `launch-redirect.ps1 -Revert` casually — that strips the hosts entries
  + cacert mods. Only when the user explicitly asks to clean up.
- Don't use Steam to launch the game for testing the redirect — Steam launches the
  exe with no `-ini:` overrides, so the backend redirects don't apply.
- Don't kill the `SUPERVIVE-Win64-Shipping` process without warning — the user may
  be mid-test.
- Don't propose another C++-exception-using payload for injection. We tested
  three canary variants; the packer's exception handler kills the process even
  with `__CxxFrameHandler3` properly imported.
- Don't propose `ScanPrimaryAssetTypesFromConfig` as a shim target again — the
  function `__report_gsfailure`s mid-call regardless of thread context (verified
  via off-thread call, thread-hijack with fresh stack, thread-hijack with own
  stack, and APC on the real game thread).

## Memory layout

`memory/MEMORY.md` is the auto-loaded index. Project memory files (loaded on
demand when topics come up):
- `supervive-revival-overview` — goals, stack, redirect approach
- `supervive-milestone{1,2,3}-status` — chronological milestones
- `supervive-milestone3-trackb-status` — interactive write-back endpoints
- `supervive-hero-roster-blocker` — points at `docs/hero-roster-attempts.md`
